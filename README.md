# arcpy-server-util-rest

This is a Pythonic API for consuming REST services from ArcGIS server. These are Python bindings for consuming services and administering an ArcGIS 10.1 Server via its RESTful APIs. 

Please note THESE ARE NOT COMPLETE -- not all of the REST API has
been wrapped or implemented. If you have a feature that you'd
like to see working, then by all means feel free to contribute a
patch.
